In modern cybersecurity, intrusion detection systems (IDS) have evolved into Intrusion 
Prevention Systems (IPS), which not only detect but actively block malicious activities. The 
integration of IPS within a Unified Threat Management (UTM) framework consolidates 
multiple security services under one management umbrella. This project aims to build a robust 
IPS using SNORT, addressing challenges like ensuring accurate signatures, managing large 
traffic efficiently, and optimizing deployment.
